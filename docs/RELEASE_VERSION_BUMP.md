# Managing a Package-Based Monorepo Using Nx

This guide explains how to manage a monorepo based on Nx, how to release packages properly, and handle version bumps.

## Step 1: Make Necessary Changes

- Implement the required changes in the project, whether itâ€™s new features, bug fixes, or updates to existing code.

## Step 2: Stage and Commit Your Changes

- Use the following commands to stage and commit all your changes:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "describe the changes made"
  ```

## Step 3: Run the Release Process

- After committing all the changes, you can start the release process by running:

  ```bash
  npm run release
  ```

### Step 3a: Breakdown of `npm run release` Command

- `"sync": "git fetch --prune && git fetch --prune origin \"+refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\""`:

  - This command synchronizes the local git repository with the remote, ensuring that all tags and branches are up-to-date, including pruning any deleted references.

- `"release": "npm run sync && npx nx release && nx run-many --target=nx-release-publish --all=true"`:
  - **`npm run sync`**: First, it runs the sync command to fetch tags and keep the local git repo synchronized with the remote.
  - **`npx nx release`**: This triggers the Nx release process, typically responsible for version bumping and tagging the packages that need to be released.
  - **`nx run-many --target=nx-release-publish --all=true`**: Runs the release-publish target for all the projects in the monorepo, handling the publication of packages to npm or other registries as defined.

## Step 4: Push Changes to the Remote Repository

- Finally, push the committed changes and tags to the remote repository:

  ```bash
  git push && git push --tags
  ```

Following these steps ensures a smooth version bump and release process within a monorepo managed by Nx.
